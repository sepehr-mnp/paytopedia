# Quick Start Guide - EIP-7702 Payment Gateway

Get up and running with the EIP-7702 Payment Gateway in 5 minutes!

## 1. Installation

```bash
cd eip7702-payment-gateway
npm install
```

## 2. Run Tests

Verify everything works:

```bash
npm test
```

You should see **32 tests passing** âœ…

## 3. Deploy Contracts Locally

Deploy to the hardhat network:

```bash
npm run deploy:local
```

This will output:
- `TokenTransferer` address
- `PaymentGateway` address
- Deployment details saved to `deployment.json`

## 4. Core Components

### PaymentGateway Contract
- Manages user payment addresses
- Tracks which addresses belong to which users
- Configurable hot wallet for receiving tokens
- Owner-controlled access

### TokenTransferer Contract
- Designed to be delegated to via EIP-7702
- Two main functions:
  - `transfer(token, recipient)` - Transfer one token
  - `transferMultiple(tokens[], recipient)` - Transfer multiple tokens

### JavaScript Utilities
Located in `scripts/eip7702Utils.js`:
- `encodeEIP7702Authorization()` - Create EIP-7702 authorizations
- `prepareTokenTransferTx()` - Prepare transfer transactions
- `prepareBatchTokenTransferTx()` - Prepare batch transfers
- `validateAuthorization()` - Validate authorizations

## 5. Workflow: How It Works

### For Service Operators:

```
1. Create random wallet address for each user
   â†’ Wallet A, Wallet B, Wallet C, etc.

2. User sends tokens to their assigned wallet
   â†’ User sends USDC to Wallet A

3. Service signs EIP-7702 authorization
   â†’ Signs with Wallet A's private key
   â†’ Delegates code to TokenTransferer

4. Service sends ONE transaction
   â†’ Calls TokenTransferer.transfer()
   â†’ All tokens move to hot wallet atomically

5. Tokens now in hot wallet!
   â†’ Ready for processing, swapping, etc.
```

### Key Innovation:
- **Traditional**: Need to send ETH to each address + make separate transactions
- **EIP-7702**: Service just signs once + makes one transaction per collection batch

## 6. File Structure

```
contracts/
  â”œâ”€â”€ TokenTransferer.sol      # Delegated contract
  â”œâ”€â”€ PaymentGateway.sol       # Service contract  
  â””â”€â”€ TestERC20.sol            # Test token

```

## 7. Testing Specific Features

Run specific test suites:

```bash
# Test PaymentGateway only
npm test -- --grep "PaymentGateway"

# Test TokenTransferer only
npm test -- --grep "TokenTransferer"

# Test single token transfer
npm test -- --grep "Should transfer all tokens"

# Test batch transfers
npm test -- --grep "transferMultiple"
```

## 8. Gas Optimization Highlights

From test output:
- **PaymentGateway deployment**: ~727 KB
- **TokenTransferer deployment**: ~408 KB  
- **Single token transfer**: ~51.4K gas
- **Batch token transfer (2 tokens)**: ~70K gas

This is highly optimized for batch operations!

## 9. Network Support

Currently configured for:
- **Hardhat** (local development)
- **Sepolia** (testnet)

To deploy to Sepolia:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_key SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_rpc npm run deploy:sepolia
```

## 10. Security Features

- Access control on all admin functions
- Chain ID validation to prevent cross-chain attacks
- Authorization nonce to prevent replay attacks
- Zero address validations
- Token approval not needed (EIP-7702 advantage)

## 11. Next Steps

1. **Review the contracts**: Check `contracts/` folder
2. **Study the utilities**: See `scripts/eip7702Utils.js`
3. **Read implementation guide**: See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
4. **Deploy on testnet**: Use Sepolia RPC

## 12. Troubleshooting

**"Module not found"**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**"Cannot find module '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-...'"**
```bash
npm install
```

**"Tests not running"**
```bash
npm run compile
npm test
```

## 13. Key Concepts

### What is EIP-7702?

EIP-7702 allows temporary code delegation on an address. This means:
- Address A temporarily gets code of Contract B
- Contract B functions can execute "as" Address A
- After execution, Address A reverts to normal

### Why It's Powerful for Payments

1. **No upfront funding**: Don't need to send ETH to payment addresses
2. **Atomic operations**: All tokens transfer in one transaction
3. **Lower costs**: One transaction per batch instead of many
4. **Better UX**: Simpler payment flow for users

## 14. Deployment Checklist

Before mainnet deployment:

- [ ] Run all tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Check gas reports
- [ ] Audit private key management
- [ ] Set up secure key storage
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Test on Sepolia first
- [ ] Verify contract addresses
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Document procedures

## 15. Support

For issues:
1. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Review test files for examples
3. Check contract comments
4. Verify Hardhat is properly installed

Happy deploying! ðŸš€
